# MNIST-model
Train on MNIST dataset using an MLP. The original training dataset contains 60,000 images and test contains 10,000 images. If you are short on compute, use a stratified subset of a smaller number of images. But, the test set remains the same 10,000 images. Compare against RF and Logistic Regression models.  The metrics can be: F1-score, confusion matrix. What do you observe? What all digits are commonly confused?
